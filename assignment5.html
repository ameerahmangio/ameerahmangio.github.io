Lesson 5 & 6 Summary: 

Activity 5-3: Today I learned about the Honeycomb model of social media websites created by three Canadian academicians in 2011.
I had never heard of a model that outlines the fundamental components of social media firms. This will be helpful to me if I decide
to work in the social media industry since I'll need to understand what attracts users to social media for it to become what it is
renowned for. Recognizing that the website also covers the marketing component is crucial for me since I need and/or desire this
knowledge for work-related reasons and because typical high school courses didn't cover much marketing-related material.

Activity 6-3: I am familiar with screen sharing and remote desktop, but I wanted to do this activity because I want to make sure that
I have more knowledge about this topic, especially if there is new information. This will help me if I am a manager for a company and
need to teach others about what we do at the company over Zoom since there are more people nowadays that would like to work remotely.
I havenâ€™t used much of the Quick Assist that is offered on Microsoft Windows, but I thought it was for something completely different
like FAQ or something else surrounding that. 

Activity 6-5: Being a participant in this activity provided a wealth of knowledge that, in my opinion, many people must be aware of since 
nobody wants to find themselves in an undesirable scenario. I've known for a very long time that there are people who duplicate the work of
others and claim it as their own, without realizing that doing so has significant repercussions. I gained much knowledge regarding the legal 
and illegal aspects of music piracy. Knowing what is unlawful is essential to me because I wouldn't want to be associated with the government 
and I wouldn't take someone else's work and claim it as my own.
