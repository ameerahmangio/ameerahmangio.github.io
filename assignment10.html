  <p>This activity was the most challenging to me compared to
    assignment 9 with HTML. It took me a while to figure out how everything
    works, but I was hopefully able to do this correctly. This coding will be helpful
    when I am also designing a website and would want to make it more eye-catching because,
    without colors and designs, people wouldn't be as interested if it was a boring-looking
    website.

  <p>I could add any font, color, or animation I want for my or company's website
    and it would attract customers to the website and also reach others by them sharing to
    their friends or family. CSS is very new to me and never heard of it before, but now I have
    experience with web designing and that will be helpful if I choose to be a web designer.
