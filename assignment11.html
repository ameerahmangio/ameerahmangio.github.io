  <h1>Assignment 11 Summary</h1>

  <p>At the beginning of these activities, it was very overwhelming how many
    things need to be done in this assignment. It was confusing with the raster
    and vector images but I can see how graphics and multimedia would be great
    to have in coding. This can be used in the future if I want to have my own
    business and I wanted to code my own website showing images and video with
    audio of the products I will be selling.
  </p>
    
  <p>Getting more information about HTML coding and adding different codes at a
    time will increase my knowledge of when I need to use this type of coding.
    Everything in this assignment is new, and I am learning more and more about
    coding, which is important for being in the IT field even though there are
    different types of coding.
