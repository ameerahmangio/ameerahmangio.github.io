<h1>Lesson 15 Summary</h1>

  <p>Activity 15-1: Before starting lesson 15’s activities, I immediately felt a bit excited that this
week’s activities surround jobs. A quick background story about me, I have been struggling with
finding a job that is in my field for a while so having these activities will be very helpful for me
getting that job. This activity was insightful because filling out the Career Planning and Personal
Branding worksheets made me think hard about what I want to do for my future career also
what I would need to do to better myself in the workforce. My goal is to get a very good-paying job
that I can enjoy doing because doing something that you are not happy with will not turn out well. 
</p>
  <p>Activity 15-2: I find watching the YouTube videos on the channel assigned for this week's
exercise to be really encouraging since those who work in IT are offering their best advice for
success, and after I leave Harper, it will be necessary for me. The resources supplied for this
assignment helped me learn about the many IT careers available, the entry-level schooling required
for the particular occupation in which I'm interested, and how to compare the various positions.
I was also able to find out the expected median salary for each job, which will aid me in choosing
employment. I must become comfortable with this as soon as possible because I am almost finished with
school and must find a full-time IT job as soon as possible.
</p>
  <p>Activity 15-3: I recently requested that the career center at Harper update my resume because I
want to catch the eye of recruiters so that I may land a fantastic, steady job. Since LinkedIn is
(in my view) the best platform for finding a full-time job based on how professional everything
is on that job-seeking website, reading the LinkedIn Basics is a terrific source of information.
In order to completely comprehend and have a standout resume and profile, I am studying the tips
and tricks. If I put these suggestions to use, I will be able to get employment.
