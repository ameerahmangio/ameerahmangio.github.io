Lesson 2 Summary: 

Activity 2-1: Learning more about the architecture of the web browsers will give more knowledge on how everything works together to get the result of 
the actual browser. This information will assist me whenever there is an unidentified problem at first with the web, but I will remember these facts and
be able to trace every step until I find that solution. While I was reading the first article, the photos that were used are from years ago because I 
remember that design when I first started using a computer. Also, the navigation that was gone over in the article was kind of a test for me to make sure 
that I still have that material in my head. 

Activity 2-2: Using the different web browsers took a while with all the downloading and different tests like the speed of opening different websites and
seeing which web browser works best for me. Although I haven't used Brave before this activity, being able to explore a different online browser allows me
to see what other alternatives are now accessible. Now that I've done this exercise, I may switch web browsers. I've been using Google Chrome for a very long
time, therefore I believe it's time to switch to something more convenient. 

Activity 2-6: By having greater functionality, multimedia support, accessibility, quicker page loads, easier development, higher performance, and mobile
compatibility, HTML5 is highly significant to both online users and developers. I learned about it thanks to my choice of activity. Users like me will find
HTML5 to be beneficial in making code easier to read, and screen readers have many different helpful features. From past classes that I took for my major
(Info Tech AAS/Network Admin) with the different NET classes, having HTML5 will be fantastic since I have seen and even done some coding and found that it can
be challenging to read or grasp at first.
