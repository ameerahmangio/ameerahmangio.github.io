  <h1>Assignment 2 Summary</h1>

  <p>Activity 2-1: Learning more about the architecture of the web browsers will give more knowledge on how everything
    works together to get the result of the actual browser. This information will assist me whenever there is an
    unidentified problem at first with the web, but I will remember these facts and be able to trace every step until I
    find that solution. While I was reading the first article, the photos that were used are from years ago because I
    remember that design when I first started using a computer. Also, the navigation that was gone over in the article
    was kind of a test for me to make sure that I still have that material in my head.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 2-2: Using the different web browsers took a while with all the downloading and different tests like the
    speed of opening different websites and seeing which web browser works best for me. Although I haven't used Brave
    before this activity, being able to explore a different online browser allows me to see what other alternatives are
    now accessible. Now that I've done this exercise, I may switch web browsers. Given how long I've been using Google
    Chrome, I believe it's time to move to a more useful browser. Because of the features it provides, tab saving when
    you shut down the software, improved speed, and access to the parameters for how much RAM and CPU may be utilized, I
    would probably move to Opera GX.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 2-6: By having greater functionality, multimedia support, accessibility, quicker page loads, easier
    development, higher performance, and mobile compatibility, HTML5 is highly significant to both online users and
    developers. I learned about it thanks to my choice of activity. Users like me will find HTML5 is beneficial in
    making code easier to read, and screen readers have many different helpful features. When looking at the HTML5test,
    my browser (Google Chrome) has the highest score out of the other browsers. From past classes that I took for my
    major (Info Tech AAS/Network Admin) with the different NET classes, having HTML5 will be fantastic since I have seen
    and even done some coding and found that it can be challenging to read or grasp at first.
