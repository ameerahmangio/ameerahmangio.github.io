  <p>I learned about web accessibility today and it makes me think
    about how I am grateful for all the tools that are available
    on the internet for those who struggle in general like how I had
    a rough start to figuring out the developer part of Github.
  </p>
    
  <p>Being able to use the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation tool helped
    me find errors in my web pages and what I should do next to fix them
    so itâ€™s easier to access. This will be in my current and future because
    right now I am using the tool to improve my web pages and in the future
    when coding comes up and I want to be sure that everything is perfect with
    no errors.
