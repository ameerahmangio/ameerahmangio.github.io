  <h1>Assignment 4 Summary</h1>

  <p>Activity 4-3: I totally forgot the existence of Thunderbird and I have tried it in the past, but I recall that I
    didn’t prefer it at the time. This activity gave me the opportunity to see the changes in Mozilla: Thunderbird and
    also to find out if it’s a good email program for me or not still. I did not realize that this email program was
    cross-platform until today because I always thought that you would need to have Mozilla Firefox, but it’s actually
    its own application. This would be good for me when I have a work email that I would need to pay attention to all
    the time because the design looks suited for it and I like customizing my personal email so I still prefer using
    websites or the mail application to access my emails.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 4-4: Since I am aware that some individuals fabricate sender addresses to make it appear as though they
    are the legitimate firm when they are not, I learned more about email spoofing in-depth. I've been tricked in the
    past and have seen them in my inbox several times, but I can tell whether anything is true or not. I learned how to
    read an email's complete headers in the exercise, which is crucial knowledge to have in order to prevent email
    delivery problems, spam, and other problems.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 4-5: Although I was unaware that mailing lists existed, it makes sense given how businesses distribute the
    same email to several people. It has all of that person's information, and when that person decides they are no
    longer interested, they may unsubscribe from them. I have already read about all six of the top mailing list
    providers for 2023. The mailing lists are there to exchange material, news, and goods that are going on sale or new
    ones coming out, so if there is ever a moment when I work with a firm that sends emails to all of their clients,
    then this would be great.
