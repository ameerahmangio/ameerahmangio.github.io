Lesson 7 Summary: 

Activity 7-2: The activity is extremely beneficial for me since I need to understand
IP addressesif I want to work in the networking industry, and I even need to understand
my personal network because my family and I have recently been experiencing issues with
our present network. I've conducted tests in thepast to identify the issue and look at all
the data associated with the IP address. Since there are a lot more people using electronic
devices now than there were a few years ago, it becomes especially important for me to retain
the information presented in this activity's objective since I am well aware that many individuals
experience issues with their routers.

Activity 7-3: I was able to easily recall these instructions since I had used them to learn 
their purposes and when to apply them because this exercise required numerous steps to help the
user comprehend their internet access. This will apply to both my present and future lives as I do
almost everything online. Without the Internet, I wouldn't be able to do my tasks at home and at work.
The corporation that I will work for in the future, requires a strong internet connection to continue
offering its service to consumers and to assist them when something goes wrong, especially because I
will be working with a business in the future.

Activity 7-6: I completed this activity a year ago in a different class, and doing it again reveals a huge amount
of information, including whether the changes to the wired and wireless connections were better or worse,
whether the costs of everything increased or decreased, whether the internet service providers are worthwhile,
and more. This knowledge will be helpful to me in the future, especially if I want to find the strongest internet
service provider for my home so I can use and enjoy my devices without interruptions. I would also like to know the
best choice with affordable prices.
