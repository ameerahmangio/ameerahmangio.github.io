  "During this final week of class, I learned about Project Management and the Gantt Chart.
    This is the best course of action when organizing tasks and personally for me: I enjoy
    keeping all my things organized. The material learned this week will be helpful for me
    currently and in the future when I do have projects to work on, I will know what tasks
    need to be done, how long it took for me to complete them, and also know when that deadline
    will be. The Gantt Chart is user-friendly as well and itâ€™s not too complicated which will be
    helpful for users to figure out without the help of another person. Something that is interesting
    is that I have never heard of this chart till now."
