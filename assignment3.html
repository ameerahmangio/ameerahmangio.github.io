Lesson 3 Summary: 

Activity 3-2: The fact that two of the four online browsers returned the same results when I 
searched "web search engine" while the other two returned different websites caused me to respond
with disbelief to this behavior. I had anticipated that all of those browsers would produce the same
results, but given how different each search engine operates, it does make sense why some may not.
When I work in IT and am attempting to locate the best VPN service, I would need to get the greatest
results for the client or for my own usage, thus it is crucial for me to know which web browser has the 
best user experience today and in the future. I wouldn't want to provide anyone, including myself, with
a subpar VPN service that is unreliable and has several problems. 

Activity 3-4: I'm particularly interested in learning more about SEO (search engine optimization) since there
may be methods to naturally enhance the search engine. Personally, I believe that it is essential to grasp this
because I need to comprehend the web's environment, particularly if I want to use it constantly. I want to learn
because I don't want to work in a field that I don't understand since it would make working with technology simpler
for me. By using those natural search engine results, SEO can discover new ways to boost the amount and quality of 
visitors to your website.

Activity 3-5: I had no idea there was a website that provides a wide range of current and historical information on
any URL, but not surprised. I enjoy studying the evolution of technology, and this would be useful to me personally
if I ever decide to work as an IT instructor as I would be able to understand the steps that led to the development
of computers and all the specifics involved in becoming an expert in the area. I can visualize whether websites are
better or worse by learning the modifications, summaries, collections, and all the other information published on the
Wayback Machine website and there will be new opportunities to continue on the path of success.
