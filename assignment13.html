  <p>Today I learned about JavaScript and have not worked with this programming
    language until now. This will help me grow my skills in different programming
    languages and benefit my future because if my job requires me to write programs
    in JavaScript, I will remember how to get started.
  </p>
    
  <p>JavaScript is an important programming language that allows users to interact
    with web pages simply and without it, nothing would be able to be accessed so
    if I choose to become a web developer: this lesson would benefit me. The activities
    in Lesson 13 taught me how to display a button on my HTML page and be able to click
    on it to make it activate which I think that itâ€™s pretty cool.
