  <h1>Assignment 9 Summary</h1>

  <p>This lesson was about HTML and I used the HTML coding format in a previous class.
    This week taught me again how to use HTML language especially how to make a simple web page
    that will help me in the future if I choose to do web development for creating a web page for
    business purposes to promote the company I am working for. I’m glad that there are HTML
    validators to make sure that my work is correct because I wouldn’t want to publish a website page
    that doesn’t work properly or doesn’t look right. I did also use HTML currently for the assignment
    change which helps me understand how to format the assignment text to that markup language myself
    for a class. Researching free web hosting services as well helps me view which websites are allowing
    me to make my own site for free for personal use or professional.
