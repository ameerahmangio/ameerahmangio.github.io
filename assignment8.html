Lesson 8 Summary: 

Activity 8-2: I've always thought that browser security was vital, and everyone else should too.
I once got a virus, which is never fun because I didn't know how to get rid of it at the time.
I am aware that there are a few browsers out there that are developed with the express purpose
of stealing people's personal information while also appearing to be professionally designed.
I regularly clean my browser's cache and get rid of add-ons that I don't use. I constantly make
sure the browsers I use frequently are up to current. I conducted some further research and discovered
that it may be possible that add-ons can get hacked like anything else and do everything to ruin a person's
life, so I learned that I should periodically get better add-ons that are connected to the add-on that I previously uninstalled. 

Activity 8-3: I decided to do this because I want to make sure I don't have any malware on my computer,
and periodically testing my system will make me and others who undertake this activity feel safer. I can
determine which antivirus software will benefit my computer by looking at a chart of all the features that
are included or excluded for each antivirus program. This will apply to both my present and my future because
antivirus software is essential for spotting such viruses, and if they do, I will need to take action on my own
to identify the virus. Additionally, if I could determine where it could have originated from, I would then be
able to completely prevent contracting the virus. 

Activity 8-5: Although I considered the Wikiversity website example to be a little insecure in terms of design
when I completed this assignment, I did try it out and discovered that my IP address actively denied the UPnP
Probes. I initially assumed that was a terrible thing, but it's actually good news since it implies that users—in
this case, me—will be less vulnerable to attacks from hackers. Strong firewalls are essential for my personal computer
and my business computer since they provide defense against external cyberattacks such as those from malicious
software or even the network. Who would want to have their personal information in the hands of another person?
That is why I constantly want to make sure that everything I possess is secure.
