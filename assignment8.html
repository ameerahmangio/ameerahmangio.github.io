  <h1>Assignment 8 Summary</h1>

  <p>Activity 8-2: I've always thought that browser security was vital, and everyone else should too. I once got
    a virus, which is never fun because I didn't know how to get rid of it at the time. I am aware that there
    are a few browsers out there that are developed with the express purpose of stealing people's personal
    information while also appearing to be professionally designed. I regularly clean my browser's cache and
    get rid of add-ons that I don't use. I constantly make sure the browsers I use frequently are up to current.
    I conducted some further research and discovered that it may be possible that add-ons can get hacked like anything
    else and do everything to ruin a person's life, so I learned that I should periodically get better add-ons that are
    connected to the add-on that I previously uninstalled. On my Google Chrome, I have an adblocker called AdGuard
    AdBlocker and I have had it for a long time, so I downloaded Adblock Plus which has many positive reviews and it's
    doing the job nicely by blocking out unnecessary ads.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 8-3: I decided to do this because I want to make sure I don't have any malware on my computer, and
    periodically testing my system will make me and others who undertake this activity feel safer. I can determine which
    antivirus software will benefit my computer by looking at a chart of all the features that are included or excluded
    for each antivirus program. This will apply to both my present and my future because antivirus software is essential
    for spotting such viruses, and if they do, I will need to take action on my own to identify the virus. Additionally,
    if I could determine where it could have originated from, I would then be able to completely prevent contracting the
    virus. I choose to download Avast Antivirus which is free software and the results that came up were that everything
    is mostly clean so nothing from browser threats and viruses & malware, but I am vulnerable to fake websites, my PC
    webcam is vulnerable to spying, and there are 9 sensitive items that are prime targets for attack.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 8-5: Although I considered the Wikiversity website example to be a little insecure in terms of design
    when I completed this assignment, I did try it out and discovered that my IP address actively denied the UPnP
    Probes. I initially assumed that was a terrible thing, but it's actually good news since it implies that users—in
    this case, me—will be less vulnerable to attacks from hackers. Strong firewalls are essential for my personal
    computer and my business computer since they provide defense against external cyberattacks such as those from
    malicious software or even the network. Who would want to have their personal information in the hands of another
    person? That is why I constantly want to make sure that everything I possess is secure.
