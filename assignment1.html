  <h1>Assignment 1 Summary</h1>

  <p>Activity 1-1: This activity was able to remind me of the basics of the internet and it’s helpful for me since the
    classes I have had previously were mainly about the deep details of other parts of the internet. I was able to learn
    more about the Internet's connectivity pathways, and it will help me understand how everything is connected since
    that is one of the essential points of the Internet. This information will help me currently and in the future
    because without knowing the basic of the internet, it will be very difficult to find a job in my field if I don’t
    know the basics of how the internet works.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 1-5: I learned that IP addresses are not going to pinpoint specifically a person’s location, but more of a
    broad geographical area which is good because if someone is trying to track you down: it would be difficult to find
    that person since the location will show a wide range of other users. Knowing this information will reassure me that
    hackers won’t be able to pinpoint me directly and this activity reminds me that soon I should get a VPN as well so
    the person tracking me down will have a very hard time.
  </p>
  <p>Activity 1-6: I am familiar with the traceroute tool from previous classes, but sometimes I do have problems
    remembering how to read the information that is shown, thus doing this task helped me grasp the traceroute tool
    more. If I decide to pursue a career in networking specifically, this knowledge will be useful since I'll need to
    understand the flow of data on the internet as it moves from source to destination. I will be able to see the
    causes of response lags and routing loops in the network's traffic between packet-switched nodes. It could also
    apply if I am having internet problems on my home PC, I will be able to figure out the problem on my own.
