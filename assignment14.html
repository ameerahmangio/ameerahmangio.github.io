VALUES ('Bella', 'Meridith B Grey', 'Skagen 26', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');</p>

  <h1 style="color:blue;">Assignment 14</h1>

  <p>Lesson 14 was a challenge for me and I am hoping that I did these activities
    correctly in my assignment 14. This is my first time working with the structure
    query language (SQL), but I have learned about this language in the past. It is
    important for me to know the languages in the coding world if I choose to do coding
    because this language is used for databases to manage and other actions.
  </p>
    
  <p>I learned how to write single-table SELECT, multiple-table SELECT, and INSERT, UPDATE,
    and DELETE statements so I know the basics of how to choose the data from the database
    that needs to be added, fixed, or removed. SQL makes things easier for the user to get
    specific data from the database also knowing SQL will make it easier to understand other
    programming languages like Java and Python.
